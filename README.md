# code-refactor

In this first homework, the goal was to refactor the html and css codes provided. The changes applied are listed below:

1. Changed the html elements to more semantic elements to help any developer understand the natural flow of the html. This consisted of tinkering with the syntax of the elements we were given initially. For example, changing the div tags to appropriate tags like nav, header, section, etc.

2. Condensed the css code when certain classes and id's had the same properties, so it made sense to combine them to clean up the flow of the css code. For example, the images in the main section had the same margins, font family,  text-align, etc. 

3. Fixed broken image links, and made sure the css files were linked in the html file so that changes were reflected correctly. 

4. Adjusted the title, header, and footer to make the elements semantic and accurate to the websites purpose.

Note: I feel like this activity went well, and the finished product is more semantic and the code reflects more dry code. Yay!
